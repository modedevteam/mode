## Why Mode?

- **Personal and Powerful**: Mode connects directly to providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, and more&mdash;your code and interactions stay private. Since there's no middle layer, you can instantly upgrade to the latest models without relying on third-party tools to catch up or pay their upgrade fees.

- **Built for the Enterprise**: Mode is purpose-built for developers who need configurability. You bring your own keys, making it easy to integrate with providers already approved in your organization. With no tracking or servers, Mode is ideal for secure environments that require data privacy and control.
