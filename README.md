# Mode

Mode writes code automatically with no manual approval or merge steps. It lets you connect directly to your favorite language models, and instantly upgrade to the latest models. Mode is open-source, has no third-party servers, token limits, or upgrade fees. Try it out today!

### ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Weekly Highlight ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

* **New: GitHub Copilot Integration!** Mode now supports GitHub Copilot's language models through the [VS Code Language Model API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model). If you have a GitHub Copilot subscription, you can make unlimited Mode requests without any additional API keys or setup.

## Why Mode?

- **Personal and Powerful**: Mode connects directly to providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, and more&mdash;your code and interactions stay private. Since there's no middle layer, you can instantly upgrade to the latest models without relying on third-party tools to catch up or pay their upgrade fees.

- **Built for the Enterprise**: Mode is purpose-built for developers who need configurability. You bring your own keys, making it easy to integrate with providers already approved in your organization. With no tracking or servers, Mode is ideal for secure environments that require data privacy and control.

## Be part of the journey!

We created Mode because we love building, just like you. Our journey is just beginning â€“ we're continuously improving and have an exciting roadmap ahead: smart autocompletion, automating routine tasks, collaborating across files, and supporting even more language models and providers.
